# PawDash - Preview

_Your personal preview environment is created directly from your local code - perfect for demos, testing, and sharing prototypes with stakeholders._

## Next steps

   _Test it and/or share it with stakeholders. NOTE: This app is public._<br>
   [Open your app](https://main.d1ifad8nbrmehn.amplifyapp.com)

2. Manage your app in the Amplify console
   _Monitor performance, view logs, configure custom domains, and manage deployments._<br>
   [Open the Amplify console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/d1ifad8nbrmehn/overview)

3. Go live!
   _Get production ready and set up a complete CI/CD pipeline. You'll be able to automatically deploy when you push to Git, have rollback capabilities, view build history and logs, and have your build process run in the cloud._
